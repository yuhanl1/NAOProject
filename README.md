# NAOProject
This project used a humanoid robot to develop a system that can play the role of the parent(s) taking care of their babies. On the one hand, the robot can be as a partner of babies playing with them. On the other hand, the robot is responsible for monitoring the babies and detecting dangerous situations to alarm their parent(s). Developed an app running on the mobiles, the back server, and the robot.
